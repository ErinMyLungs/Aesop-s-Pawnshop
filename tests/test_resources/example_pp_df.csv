I've had the card since July when it first came out and it's been great, no problems or issues at all. It pretty much looks brand new, as can be seen in the pictures. It hasn't left my case since I got it. It includes and comes with all the original packaging, also pictured. I currently have it in the anti-static bag that came with my 2080 Ti, but I can get the original anti-static bag back no problem as I used it to give an old GPU to a friend.

I'm asking for $650 and I'm pretty firm on the price.

\*I'm only really interested in local, for me that's 95687. I'm also a student at Sac State (Mon-Thurs), so if it's more convenient to meet up there I'm always open to that as well.\*

Nearly complete build, just needs a hard drive. I used this build for 1080p144hz gaming and streaming. None of the hardware has been overclocked. The headphone jack on the front panel is finicky and requires the cable to be going in a certain way, so I usually use the back.
